## How to run

1. `git clone` repo
1. make virtual environment (called `venv` so gitignore could omit it)
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
Use proper `fasttext` wheel for your computer architecture (see [https://github.com/Haranoi17/AIPO_geoguesser/tree/text_to_language_prediction](https://github.com/Haranoi17/AIPO_geoguesser/tree/text_to_language_prediction))
1. run application: `py app.py` (or `python app.py`)

If you want to change input file, there are some examples in `app/dataset`.
